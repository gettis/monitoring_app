# monitoring_app
Project for CSCI-UA 480-005 Large Scale Web Applications Course

The project has two parts, A stand alone application that scrapes and monitors apps and a inter-project app that you include in django projects with the app you want to mnitor. 


This is the stand alone app. you can run the application by:

activating the virtualenv :  . venv/bin/activate

pip install all dependencies:  sudo pip install -r requirments.txt

run server from monitor_app/ : python manage.py runserver


This app will ask you for a url to scrapes. This is where the other part of the project comes in.

The second part of this project is called metrix. It is included in this test target project that we use to test.
